How to Follow this home lab Setup Guide:
---
This guide is designed to help you through the process of setting up your home lab. While it won't walk you through every step, it will provide the general direction you need. You'll need to do some research on your own—whether through Google or YouTube—to learn and troubleshoot as you go. However, whenever I feel that existing resources are unclear or overly complicated, I’ve provided more detailed, step-by-step instructions to simplify the setup.

## Home Lab Vs Purple Range
On my GitHub, you'll find two key repositories. The **Home Lab** repository provides guidance on setting up a complete home lab environment, covering essentials like DNS, DMZ, backups, and vCenter. The **Purple Range** repository walks you through creating a functional purple range for practicing both offensive and defensive security. It includes tools with pre-configured CVE attacks, allowing you to focus more on blue team activities while simulating real-world scenarios.

Once you are done with the Home Lab section or already have a Home Lab move over to the Purple Range Repo to start setting up your range.
